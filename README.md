## Academic-Projects
This repository contains all of my projects completed for my university degree (Computer Science and Econometrics). As I am studying in Poland, most of them are in Polish. Most of them have knitted R-Markdown html files and are developed in R. 

### Renewable energy [PL - R]
#### Intro
Basic analysis of the world's usage of renewable sources of energy and an attempt to look for reasons as to why some countries clearly have a higher percentage of using renewable sources compared to the rest of alternatives.
#### Packages
Packages needed to knit the file:
* library(dplyr)
* library(tidyr)
* library(mice)
* library(ggplot2)
* library(psych)
* library(ggthemes)
#### Additional Information
To knit the file user should change the working directory - second chunk of the code <my_source <- "C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Renewable_Energy/DANE">. The data I am working with is included in *DANE*. Data comes straight from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/).
