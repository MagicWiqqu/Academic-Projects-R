## Academic-Projects
This repository contains all of my projects completed for my university degree (Computer Science and Econometrics). As I am studying in Poland, most of them are in Polish. Most of them have knitted R-Markdown HTML files and are developed in R. Some of them have been co-authored, and the co-authors are stated in the reports' title and headers (Word and/or PDF files).

### Renewable energy [PL - R]
#### Intro

* library(psych)
* library(ggthemes)
#### Additional Information
To knit the file, the user should change the working directory - second chunk of the code <my_source <- "C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Renewable_Energy/DANE">. The data I am working with is included in *DANE*. Data comes straight from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/).
