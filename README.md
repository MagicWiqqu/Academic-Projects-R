## Academic-Projects
This repository contains all of my projects completed for my university degree (Computer Science and Econometrics). As I am studying in Poland, most of them are in Polish. Most of them have knitted R-Markdown html files and are developed in R. 

### Renewable energy [PL]
#### Intro

Packages needed to knit the file:
